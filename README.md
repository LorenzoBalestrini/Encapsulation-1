# Exercise: Encapsulation 1
* achieve encapsulation using *getters*/*setters* and without using *Lombok* for a class `House` that has the following instance variables:
  * an int `floorsNumber`
  * a string `address`
  * an array of strings `residentsNames`
* use a tester class to:
  * set the values by asking the user to input them
    * for the `residentsNames`, the user will have to input a list of names separated by a comma (e.g. `John,Lucy,Peter`)
  * prints the house details using the *getters* and `String.format()`
